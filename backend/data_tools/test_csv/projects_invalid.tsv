1	Human Services Interoperability Support	""	HSS	This contract will conduct interoperability activities to facilitate the exchange of information within, between, and from states and tribal organizations by facilitating lower-burden, interoperable data reporting and exchange to other state agencies and to ACF. The contract will focus on developing content that facilitates streamlined, interoperable reporting to ACF. The contract will also conduct research and evaluation activities with states and tribal organizations to assess the effectiveness of providing these interoperability artifacts for these organizations to use. The ability to share data and develop interoperable data systems is important for effective operation and oversight of these programs. This contract is designed to address these requirements and deliver needed and practical tools to accelerate implementation of data sharing and interoperable initiatives.
2	""	RESEARCH	YDD	OPRE launched the Youth Demonstration Development Project (YDD) in 2009 to systematically review the current field of research on youth development and successful transition to adulthood. The primary objective of YDD, conducted for OPRE by Mathematica Policy Research and its partner, Chapin Hall Center for Children, was to develop a conceptual framework that could be applied to existing or new ACF programs to improve the well-being of at-risk youth and increase their ability to become self-sufficient adults and avoid long-term reliance on public assistance. These frameworks will inform ACFâ€™s decisions about possible demonstrations and evaluations of innovative approaches to improving outcomes among youth at risk of not achieving self-sufficiency.
3	Annual Performance Plans and Reports	RESEARCH	APP	The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for federal programs that address the needs of vulnerable children and families throughout our society, including Native Americans, individuals with developmental disabilities, and refugees.
