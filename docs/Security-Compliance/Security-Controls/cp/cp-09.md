# Contingency Plan
## CP-9 - System Backup

a. Conduct backups of user-level information contained in [the information system] [consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives (at a minimum, incremental backups must be conducted at least weekly and full backups must be conducted at least monthly)];<br />
b. Conduct backups of system-level information contained in the system [consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives (at a minimum, incremental backups must be conducted at least weekly and full backups must be conducted at least monthly)];<br />
c. Conduct backups of system documentation, including security- and privacy-related documentation [consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives (at least monthly)]; and<br />
d. Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of backup information

## OPS Implementation

a. Backups of the OPS relational database are configured. Additionally, snapshots and replication of object-storage based repositories are configured. These backups or snapshots are configured, prescribed, and enforced using Infrastructre-as-Code that meet or exceed the 12-hour RPO requirements specified in the Business Impact Analysis document whereever and whenver permitted by Azure service limitations.<br />
b. Not applicable due to the architecture of OPS. The only content that can be backed up with OPS is user-level data.<br />
c. System documentation lives within the application itself or in the HHS GitHub organization. GitHub and HHS provides for the resilience and high availability of its services.<br />
d. Inherited from Azure
