**Transparency**

Access is no longer limited to your specific contracts only. Everyone can view everything including budget and spending data for each Portfolio and funding details for every CAN. Changes are tracked via history so you can easily understand who changed what and when.

**Improved information architecture**

Budget and spending data can be viewed in more diverse and customized ways like across a portfolio, project, or CAN, in addition to the individual agreement level.

**Autonomy**

Team Leaders, CORs and other team members can create and edit agreements directly instead of having to email the budget team to make updates.

**Built-in Approvals**

Division Directors will formally approve budget and status changes in the system rather than through email.

**Pre-planning**

Plans can be entered into the system as Drafts instead of having to wait until plans are more formalized. This will provide a more holistic view of the data across all stages of planning.
